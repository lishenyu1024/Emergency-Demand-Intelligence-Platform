## Reproducibility


All code generating the exploratory data analysis charts above has been committed to this project's GitHub repository. We will ensure any collaborator can run these scripts using the React framework or alternatives, analyzing the same input dataset to produce identical results and charts.

## Unexpected Challenges or Risks to Project Success


1.  **Data Availability/API Delays:** The greatest unforeseen risk is that the **actual availability** of data from the **Bonterra Apricot API** may be later than the expected $\mathbf{10/10}$.
2. **Data Quality Challenges:** Excessively high missing rates in critical $[demographic/income]$ fields may render certain designed KPIs **inaccurate to compute**.
